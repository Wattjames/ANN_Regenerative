# ANN_Regenerative: Optimizing Regenerative Outcomes in Decision-Making through ANN
 The purpose of the paper is to document the development of an artificial Neural Network (ANN) in order to promote best application and adoption of regenerative practices. The principal result is to introduce the applicability of ANN to decision-making in environmental monitoring and management, and an increased adoption of optimum regenerative practices. The major conclusion is that an ANN can greatly assist with regenerative outcomes as a decision-making guide, but further development must be done to increase the back-propagation of variables available.
